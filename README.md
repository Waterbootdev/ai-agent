# guided bootdev project

Do not give this program to others for them to use! It does not have all the security and safety features that a production AI agent would have. It is for learning purposes only.

Remember, what we've built is a toy version of something like Cursor/Zed's Agentic Mode, or Claude Code. Even their tools aren't perfectly secure, so be careful what you give it access to, and don't give this code away to anyone else to use.
